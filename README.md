# Security_Camera_Project
This was a website made for AP Computer Science Final project. This was supposed to be a group project but the commit history can tell you the story. 

This project used a raspberry pi camera to stream video and was displayed on to a video and ran frame by frame through OpenCV to detect people. It sent an email when people were detected.
